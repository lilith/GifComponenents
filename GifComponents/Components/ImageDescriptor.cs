	/// Describes a single image within a Graphics Interchange Format data 
	/// stream.
	/// See http://www.w3.org/Graphics/GIF/spec-gif89a.txt section 20.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// Each image in the Data Stream is composed of an Image Descriptor, an 
	/// optional Local Color Table, and the image data.  Each image must fit 
	/// within the boundaries of the Logical Screen, as defined in the 
	/// Logical Screen Descriptor.
	/// 
	/// The Image Descriptor contains the parameters necessary to process a 
	/// table based image. The coordinates given in this block refer to 
	/// coordinates within the Logical Screen, and are given in pixels. This 
	/// block is a Graphic-Rendering Block, optionally preceded by one or more 
	/// Control blocks such as the Graphic Control Extension, and may be 
	/// optionally followed by a Local Color Table; the Image Descriptor is 
	/// always followed by the image data.
	/// 
	/// This block is REQUIRED for an image.  Exactly one Image Descriptor must
	/// be present per image in the Data Stream.  An unlimited number of images
	/// may be present per Data Stream.
	/// 
	/// The scope of this block is the Table-based Image Data Block that 
	/// follows it. This block may be modified by the Graphic Control Extension.
	/// </remarks>
