	/// * Adapted for FxCop code analysis compliance and documentation comments

	/// * Removed "len" parameter from constructor.
	/// * Added AnalysingPixel property.
	/// * Made Learn, UnbiasNetwork and BuildIndex methods private.
	/// * Derive from LongRunningProcess to allow use of ProgressCounters.
	/// * Renamed lots of private members, local variables and methods.

	/// 	MoveNeighbouringNeurons
	/// 	MoveNeighbour
	/// 	SetNeighbourhoodAlphas
